Java Introduction :  
==================

C/C++:(1970's)
---------------
platform dependent( Operating System)          [window----window, linux-----linux, mac------mac]
runs single application at a time.

Python(1991)
-----------

platform dependent ---->platform independent(2005)

Java(1995)
-----------
platform independent (write once run anywhere)         [windows----->window, linux, mac etc..]-OS(Operating System)
runs multiple  application at a time.

Java main features: 
-------------------
Simple programming language / High Level Programming Language 

Easy to run and Debug(step by step verification)

Freeware, open source (Source code is available in web, any organisation or individual can make use of it)

Platform independent ---- Single code written is capable of running in all the operating system

Multi threading----- We can able to run multiple application at a time---- parallel execution

Portable (wind-----Linux)

More Secure (Firewall)

Terms or Components
=======
JDK:
-----
Java Development kit   

whenever i want to run or develop a program in java, jdk is essential
1.0 to 1.1,1.12,1.13,1.14,1.15.1.19,1.20,1.21,1.22,1.23,1.24
JDK=JRE+JVM
1.7/1.8 ----- preferable version/Stable Version


JRE:
----
Java Runtime Environment
It contains predefined files and library  


JVM: RAM
----
Java Virtual Machine (imaginary)
It is used for memory allocation, execution, object creation.

compiler ; or (); or { or }

interpreter ( convert to machine lang ) 

source code into bytecode 
10+20---->123456--------->9876456------->30

Tools: ( IDE-Integrated Development Environment) 
------------------------------------------------   
Notepad------time consumption will be high
Eclipse------95%-----user-friendly free tool  (Oxygen 3a,Photon,Neon)  
NetBeans


Paid tool
---------
Jdeveloper
Rational Application Developer-IBM



OOPS:
=======
Object Oriented Programming Structure
It is method of implementation in which program is organised as
collection of class, method and object.

Project ----> Package----->Class----> Method---> object

class--- collection of method and variables

method--- set of action to be performed(set of program statements)

Object--- created at run time(runtime memory allocation)---example/instance of a class
	- used to call method

Polymorphism
Abstraction
Inheritance
Encapsulation



Two standard notation or coding standard:
------------------------------------------------
Pascal notation / initcap notation:

Each word's first letter should be capital
ex: Greens_Technology

Followed in: project name,class name


Camel notation:

First word first letter should be small remaining words first letter should be capital
ex: greensTechnologyLimited


Followed in: object name, method name, variable name


pascal               pascal  camel      camel
Project--->package-->class-methods --->object



org.prasanth

Step 1:(Project creation)
--------
Create a java project(File----->New----->click java project------->Give project name(pascal notation)---click finish)

Step2:(Package creation)
-------
Inside Project---To create package----->(right click src folder of ur project--->click new--->package--->
then give package name--> finish

everything must be in small letters.
package name should start with org. or com.


Step3:(Class creation)
-----
Inside your package --- to create class----> (right click your package--->click new----->click
class---->Give class name(pascal notation)---- Finish


Step4:(Method creation)
------
Inside a class----->Give method name(by following camel notation) and press control- space 

System.out.println()-----------> sysout ctrl+space


Step5:(Main method creation)----java prg execution will start from here
------
type main and press control + space


Step6:(object creation)
------
Classname objname = new Classname();


Step7: (Method call)
------
objname.methodname();
